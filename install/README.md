# Engram Install README

You can install the Engram v2.0 layout on macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems using [Keyman](https://keyman.com/keyboards/engram)
(and [try it out online](https://keymanweb.com/#en,Keyboard_engram)).

This folder contains alternative approaches for installing native Engram keymaps for different operating systems, thanks to the kind contributions of Engram users.
